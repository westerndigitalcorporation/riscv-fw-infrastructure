/*
 * The FreeRTOS kernel's RISC-V port is split between the the code that is
 * common across all currently supported RISC-V chips (implementations of the
 * RISC-V ISA), and code which tailors the port to a specific RISC-V chip:
 *
 * + The code that is common to all RISC-V chips is implemented in
 *   FreeRTOS\Source\portable\GCC\RISC-V-RV32\portASM.S.  There is only one
 *   portASM.S file because the same file is used no matter which RISC-V chip is
 *   in use.
 *
 * + The code that tailors the kernel's RISC-V port to a specific RISC-V
 *   chip is implemented in freertos_risc_v_chip_specific_extensions.h.  There
 *   is one freertos_risc_v_chip_specific_extensions.h that can be used with any
 *   RISC-V chip that both includes a standard CLINT and does not add to the
 *   base set of RISC-V registers.  There are additional
 *   freertos_risc_v_chip_specific_extensions.h files for RISC-V implementations
 *   that do not include a standard CLINT or do add to the base set of RISC-V
 *   registers.
 *
 * CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO INCLDUE THE CORRECT
 * freertos_risc_v_chip_specific_extensions.h HEADER FILE FOR THE CHIP
 * IN USE.  To include the correct freertos_risc_v_chip_specific_extensions.h
 * header file ensure the path to the correct header file is in the assembler's
 * include path.
 *
 * This freertos_risc_v_chip_specific_extensions.h is for use on RISC-V chips
 * that include a standard CLINT and do not add to the base set of RISC-V
 * registers.
