# Code Convention 
See [code convention.htm](https://bitbucket.wdc.com/projects/CTORISCVFWINFRA/repos/infra-riscv-fw/browse)

# WD Firmware     
The “WD Firmware package” constitutes an SDK FW. It contains Firmware applications and Processor Support Package (PSP) for various cores, alongside demos which support all features.
The following README file describes how to setup a build environment for the WD RISC-V firmware. It guides how to build the program, downloading it, and debugging it on the supported platforms and cores.
The FW-Infra was verified with VMWare player v. 15 hosting Debian 9.6. This demo was based on 


#### Current FW support:
- **RTOS-AL** 
    Abstraction Layer (AL) on embedded small footprint real time operation systems (RTOS). The target is to provide homogenies API for the developer usage, so the kernel can be replaced for several different RTOS’s, without any need from the developer to change its application code. 
    Currently this AL supports FreeRTOS and ThreadX (only API's, without core) with a real running demo for FreeRTOS. 
    The structure of WD Firmware package allows quick and easy integration for more RTOS’s, Platforms, boards and new firmware features. 
    Demos is based on HiFive FW example, by SiFIve. Cuurrently the reference is part of FreeRTOS maintenance 

- **Coming soon**: more FW features and more Platform supports 

#### Current Platform and Core support:
- **HiFive1** 
- **SweRV** - running on *Nexys-A7 FPGA*

### Additional downloads
- From the repo unzip riscv-gnu-toolchain-debian.tar.gz to your designated directory for the tool chain
- From the repo unzip eclipse_mcu_2019_01.7z to your designated directory for the Eclipse MCU

      $ tar -xvf riscv-gnu-toolchain-debian.tar.gz -C [Toolchain-root]

      $ 7z x eclipse_mcu_2019_01.7z -o[Eclipse-MCU-root]

- Standard packages that are required can be installed by the following command:

      $ sudo apt-get install scons libftdi1-2 libmpfr4
    NOTE: If libmpfr4 can not be installed, in cases of newer versions '6', on the host machine, you can create a symbolic link to libmpfr.so.6
    
      $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.4 
- Download and install Java SE Runtime Environment

- For RISC-V OpenOCD, you will need the following depended libs: libusb-0.1, libusb-1.0-0-dev, libusb-dev
                
      $ sudo apt-get install libusb-0.1 libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-dev

### Building for source
- #### Preparations 
    - Launch Eclipse MCU - [Eclipse-MCU-root]/eclipse
    - Import WD firmware code:
    	- From 'Eclipse MCU' menu bar select *File* -> *Import*
    	- In the Import window select *General* -> *Existing Projects into Workspace* -> *Next*
    	- In the next Import window *Select root directory* -> *Browse*  and choose the infra-riscv-fw/WD-Firmware/ you've downloaded in 'Getting the firmware sources' section
    	- Press *'Finish'* button
- #### Build - compile and link 
    - You will need to choose a specific ***demo*** for building a full solution:
    
            From the eclipse terminal or console:
            $ cd [WD-firmware-root]/WD-Firmware/demo/build
            $ ./config.sh
            
            Then you will be asked to choose a demo.
            For more explanation on adding new demos please read the readme file on ***'/demos'***
            
    - From 'Eclipse MCU' menu bar select '*Project'* -> *'Build All'*. Note that you can select which platform to build for.
    - Since the building process use SCons build system, you can build via console/terminal. Please read the readme on ***’/build’*** 

### Platforms Downloading & debugging 
- We provide several platforms to work with, please follow the instructions for the one you preferred.

    #### Setting up Hifive1 - FTDI over USB (taken from SiFive Freedom Studio Manual v1p6).
	- Connect to your HiFive1 debug interface and type "lsusb" to see if FT2232C is connected:

            $ lsusb
            Bus ... Device ... : ID 0403:6010 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT2232C Dual USB-UART/FIFO IC
            ...
            
	- Set the ___udev___ rules to allow the device to be accessed by the plugdev group

            $ sudo cp [WD-firmware-root]/WD-Firmware/board/hifive-1/99-openocd.rules  /etc/udev/rules.d/
            
	- Add and verify current user to ___plugdev___ group

            $ sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
            $ groups
            ... plugdev ...
	- Power off/on Debian station
    #### Setting up Nexys-A7 for SweRV
    
    Since Nexys-A7 is an FPGA platform it need special handling...
    - ***Prerequisite***: Following are prerequisite running SweRV core on Xilinx FPGA on Nexys-A7 board
        - To compile the RTL please follow the instruction at this link: [swerv_eh1_fpga](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/swerv_eh1_fpga)
        - Our debugger uses the ***Olimex ARM-USB-Tiny-H*** Emulator with OpenOCD
        - Pin layout for Nexys Pmod JD header with Olimex:
        
                H4 = TDO
                H1 = nTRST
                G1 = TCK
                H2 = TDI
                G4 = TMS
                G2 = nRST

    - ***FPGA image file loading***: for loading the FPGA bit file, do the following steps:
    	- Copy the FPGA bit file /WD-Firmware/board/nexys_a7_swerv1/***swerv_eh1_reference_design.bit***
	   to uSD device (locate it at the uSD root)
    	- Attach the uSD device to the Nexys-A7 board (uSD slot is on board's bottom)
		- Set the following jumpers:  JP1 - connect JTAG & USB/SD pins.   JP2 - connect the 2 pins on 'SD' side
		- At power-on the FPGA bit file is loaded to the FPGA. LED 'Busy' should be ORANGE while flushing is done.

    #### Setting up ISS (works as simulator for EH1)
    
    There is nothing to set for SweRV ISS, just select debugger luncher (following next)..


    
- #### Eclipse MCU Debug:
    - Select from the ***'Eclipse MCU'*** menu bar ***'Run' -> 'Debug Configurations...'***; 
    - Choose the platform you wish to runs on, from **'left main windows'** menu
    - Current support:
        ```javascript
        - hifive1                              <-- HiFive Eval board
        - nexys_a7_Swerv1_eh1                  <-- Nexys A7 digilent FPGA board running SweRV EH1
        - whisper_eh1_connect_and_debug        <-- SweRV ISS simulator 
        ```
